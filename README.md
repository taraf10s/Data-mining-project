## motivations :
We chose diabetes dataset due to its significant global impact and the need to better understand the disease. Diabetes affects millions worldwide, making it a crucial area of study in order to help improve early detection and patient care.

## Goal :
Our goal for this project is to develop a model that identifies diabetes risk by analyzing relevant health metrics.We aim to categorize individuals based on diagnostic results and compare these measurements to facilitate timely intervention. This will be achieved by training the model to predict whether an individual is the patient's diabetes disease class may be Diabetic, Non-Diabetic, or Predict-Diabetic.

Additionally, we seek to identify key predictors of diabetes to support the development of tailored prevention and treatment strategies

## Data source :
The source of our dataset coming from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/diabetes-dataset.

## Dataset :
In our dataset, we provide detailed information on the types of attributes for each of the 14 columns, By clearly defining the type of each attribute, we ensure a comprehensive understanding of the data structure. This clarity is instrumental in facilitating more effective and efficient analysis, allowing for better insights and informed decision-making based on the data.
